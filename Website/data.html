            <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
            <p>
                The Songkick API is our main source of data collection at the moment. This allows us to search for past shows, <br>
                concerts and events that an artist had participated in, including details such as performance venue, performance <br>
                date and time, and show popularity. This API will be used as one of the main tools for acquiring data for use <br>
                in our website, as the data is directly related to the topic of interest, and easily mappable. Analyzing this data, <br>
                we have found that there is a drastic difference in the quantity of concerts in 2019 compared to 2020, however the locations <br>
                of the 2020 concerts are very informative for tracking trends and the pandemic's influence on live events.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also utilized the Billboard top charts from 2019 and 2020, as they sort top artists into lists at the end of each year, <br>
                allowing us to sort by genre and take the top 10 artists from each desired category.
