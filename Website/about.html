                    changes to listening due to the pandemic. Our map is for anyone who is curious how concerts have changed <br>
                    within the past 2 years and for those to watch as these types of events become more and more frequent. <br>
                    This map also has a strong impact in the importance of the live music industry and allows for a <br>
