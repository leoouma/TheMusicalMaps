# TheMusicalMaps
## Introduction
We are The Music Maps. Our goal is to understand the trends in music over the past few years, and see if modern changes to society due to the pandemic have affected our taste in music and the frequency we consume it in. We hope to visualize this data in an easy to understand way, so that we may see which genres of music are trending and whether the location and amount of listeners have changed over the last few years.

## Overview
Our group is investigating the changing trends of music and listening of users over time, specifically focusing on data before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is significant to see the ways in which habits and tendencies are altered throughout hardship, especially given the importance of the internet and online entertainment to connectivity during quarantines.

## Methodology
Web mapping can be used to visualize location data and create interactive web maps. As we believe that music trends and popularity are heavily tied with location information, we chose to use web mapping as a medium for this project to assist us in visualizing and presenting the data.
