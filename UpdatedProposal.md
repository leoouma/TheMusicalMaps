# The Musical Maps
## Introduction
We are The Music Maps. Our goal is to understand the trends in music over the past few years, and see if modern changes to society due to the pandemic have affected our taste in music and the frequency we consume it in. We hope to visualize this data in an easy to understand way, so that we may see which genres of music are trending and whether the location and amount of listeners have changed over the last few years.

## Overview
Our group is investigating the changing trends of music and listening of users over time, specifically focusing on data before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are looking at the locations and popularity of concerts from 2019-2020. Concert data is lower than usual in 2020, however the locations at which there have been events when only looking at around 80 total artists is very interesting and telling about the outcome of the pandemic. This is significant to see the ways in which habits and tendencies are altered throughout hardship, especially given the importance of the internet and online entertainment to connectivity during quarantines.

## Methodology
Web mapping can be used to visualize location data and create interactive web maps. As we believe that music trends and popularity are heavily tied with location information, we chose to use web mapping as a medium for this project to assist us in visualizing and presenting the data. We are referencing the Songkick API so when a user selects a genre, they can see the results of the concerts appear.

## UX/UI
For our UX/UI development, we brainstormed different aspects we decided were important inclusions in our final site. This work was done through our mindmaps and crazy eights, seen at the page linked below. We took this ideas and, after discussing each member's ideas, prioritized certain aspects of our design. We want to focus on accessibility and clarity, and therefore focused on color-coding as well as clear layers to our map, which is the main focus of our site.
